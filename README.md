The Digital Piano is a responsive web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the Web Audio API. It allows users to play musical notes directly in the browser by clicking on piano keys or pressing mapped keyboard keys. The project demonstrates interactive audio synthesis, responsive design, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

Features
Interactive Piano Keys: Play notes by clicking or pressing mapped keyboard keys.

Octave Control: Shift the pitch range up or down with dedicated buttons.

Waveform Selection: Choose between sine, triangle, sawtooth, and square waves for different sound textures.

Volume Control: Adjust playback volume with a slider.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Touch Support: Mobile users can tap and hold keys to sustain notes.

Visual Feedback: Keys highlight when active, providing clear user interaction cues.

Technical Implementation
Web Audio API: Used to generate sound via oscillators and gain nodes.

Dynamic DOM Generation: Piano keys are created programmatically for flexibility and scalability.

Event Handling: Supports both mouse and keyboard events for note playback.

Responsive Styling: CSS media queries ensure usability across different screen sizes.

Clean Code Structure: Separated into index.html, style.css, and index.js for maintainability.

Learning Outcomes
This project showcases:

Practical use of the Web Audio API for sound synthesis.

Building responsive UI components with CSS.

Handling real-time user input (keyboard, mouse, touch).

Structuring projects with modular files for clarity and scalability.
